# Donate and show your support for open source software #

Please consider making a donation to support the development of this software, and projects like https://code.google.com/p/twitch-bot-krashnburnz/  . Currently, only two people are working on the bot project and only myself on this project, and although we try to devote as much time as we can into improving each project, we also need to eat and pay our bills. If you feel the software is useful, please consider making a donation of any size to help offset some of the costs towards developing the software! We want you to decide what the software is worth to you, and we hope you will make a donation depending on that worth. Even $5 donations are very welcome and appreciated! Thank you in advance for your support!
